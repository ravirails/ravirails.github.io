            <p class="lead font-weight-400">Don’t Repeat Yourself (DRY) is a software development principle, the main aim of which is to reduce repetition of code. There is a misconception among many developers that they define the DRY term wrongly. They believe that reduced code is known as DRY code but hold on. DRY doesn't tell you to reduce the code, it says to reduce the multiple appearance of same code.</p>

            <p class="lead font-weight-400">Before going to deep into this article I assume that you are aware about the advantages of DRY and importance of following this principle. I am also assuming you have basic knowledge about metaprogramming and the power of metaprogramming.</p>

            <p class="lead font-weight-400">Now suppose we have an application where we have multiple controllers which are doing same funcationality like simple C-R-U-D (Create-Read-Update-Delete) operations. Then what is the best way to do things faster - Scaffolding right? Yes!</p>


            <div id="step-1" class="mt-3">
              <p class="lead font-weight-400">Scaffolding is the good way to create such controllers to develop quickly. For example look at the following example:</p>
              <pre>
                <code class="language-shell">
                  <span>rails generate scaffold book name:string description:text image_url:string price:integer isbn:string</span>
                </code>
              </pre>

              <p class="lead font-weight-400 mt-4">When you run this command you will get a controller named as <code class="language-ruby">books_controller</code>. This will look like following:</p>
              <pre>
                <code class="language-ruby">
                  <span>
                    class BooksController < ApplicationController
                      before_action :set_book, only: [:show, :edit, :update, :destroy]

                      # GET /books
                      # GET /books.json
                      def index
                        @books = Book.all
                      end

                      # GET /books/1
                      # GET /books/1.json

              <p class="lead font-weight-400 mt-4">Now suppose you need another controllers by which you need to perform only basic C-R-U-D operations then you need to run the same scaffold generator(after changing your model and attributes name) and you get the similar resource controller. Though this is fast to build the functionalities but as a professional Ruby on Rails developer (If you really love the magic of Ruby) this is not a good approach because in all such controllers you are using same code(except your resource name).</p>

              <p class="lead font-weight-400">Now this is better to write DRY controllers using some metaprogramming techniques. Believe me I am not using any advanced meta programming example here, instead I am just using only few basic methods to keep this as simple as possible.</p>

              <p class="lead font-weight-400">Enough talking lets use a practical example. We will do this by creating a concern and then including this concern into all our common controllers. Go to app/controllers/concerns folder into your project.</p>

              <p class="lead font-weight-400 mb-4">Now create a file and name as <code class="language-ruby">common_crud.rb</code> and put the following code inside this:</p>
